# Personal website

## About
A brief single page showcase website with different sections about me and my projects.

I've opted to not use any framework in order to get familiar with the grid and flex system and also work on my CSS skills.

The website is responsive, and at width's of less than 768 pixels the sideman would dissappear to the left, and instead we would have a hambuger type of button which can be use to show/hide the menu


## Technologies and tools used 

Even though I have not used any layout framework for the simple html/css/javascript code, I did however took advantage of the following tools

### [AOS library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) 

Animate on scroll library created by [Michał Sajnóg](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos), used to add the fade-in/fade-right/fade-left styling properly when scrolling over certain page elements.


### [Shape divider](https://www.shapedivider.app/)

An SVG divider generator, used to create a modern looking background-color transition between the webpage's sections.

### [Hex color to filter converter](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp)

Create by codepen user [sosuke](https://codepen.io/sosuke) I've used this tool to change the SVG icons background color, due to the images nature I needed to use the CSS ***filter:*** properly, instead of ***background-color:***

### [formsubmit.co](formsubmit.co)

I've used this to be able to connect the website's form to my e-mail address without any back-end code. Using this, the users are able to send me an e-mail via the contact form.
